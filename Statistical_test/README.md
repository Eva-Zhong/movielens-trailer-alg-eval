## Results (in HTML) format are in the "results" folder.

## click_frequency_with_position_normalize: 

This file loads rec_viewed_binary.csv, which contains:
Information about the current session: Algorithm, SeedMovie, loginId, userID
Information about the seed trailer: movieId, position, avgRating, popularity, age
Information about the current trailer: movieId, position, avgRating, popularity, age, whether the trailer is viewed.

It then runs a mixed effect logistic model, which uses information about the session, the user, and the trailer to predict if a user will click on a recommended trailer.

It then evaluates how the results differ by Algorithms.

## Statistical test - pairwise action frequency
Generates pairwise comparison of the algorithms based on how often users interact (like, dislike, wishlist) with trailer recommendations generated by different algorithms.  

## Statistical Test - watch_more_than_half
Generates pairwise comparison of the algorithms based on how often users watch more than half of trailer recommendations generated by different algorithms.
