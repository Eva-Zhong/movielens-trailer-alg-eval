	abstract = {We are proposing a new similarity based recommendation system for large-scale dynamic marketplaces. Our solution consists of an offline process, which generates long-term cluster definitions grouping short-lived item listings, and an online system, which utilizes these clusters to first focus on important similarity dimensions and next conducts a trade-off between further similarity and other quality factors such as seller trustworthiness. Our system generates these clusters from several hundred millions of item listings using a large Hadoop map-reduce based system. The clusters are learned using user queries as the main information source and therefore biased towards how users conceptually group items. Our system is deployed on several eBay sites in large-scale and has increased user-engagement and business metrics compared to the previous system. We show that utilizing user queries helps capturing similarity better. We also present experiments demonstrating that adapting the ranking function, which controls the trade-off between similarity and quality, to a specific context improves recommendation performance.},

YouTube has a great impact on Internet traffic nowadays, yet itself is suffering from a severe problem of scalability. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of YouTube and similar sites is essential to network traffic engineering and to their sustainable development. To this end, we have crawled the YouTube site for four months, collecting more than 3 million YouTube videos' data. In this paper, we present a systematic and in-depth measurement study on the statistics of YouTube videos. We have found that YouTube videos have noticeably different statistics compared to traditional streaming videos, ranging from length and access pattern, to their growth trend and active life span. We investigate the social networking in YouTube videos, as this is a key driving force toward its success. In particular, we find that the links to related videos generated by uploaders' choices have clear small-world characteristics. This indicates that the videos have strong correlations with each other, and creates opportunities for developing novel techniques to enhance the service quality.},

A number of studies investigate how to develop effective techniques to manage a huge volume of video sources, such as summarization and recommendation. However, few studies examine how these techniques affect learners' perceptions in multimedia learning systems. This article aims to examine learners' perceptions for summarization and recommendation, with an emphasis on the perspective of prior experience. In this study, we developed a multimedia content summarization and recommendation system, which can automatically extract summaries from raw video sources and recommend suitable video content to learners through emails. The results demonstrate that learners' prior experience and preferences for the presentation of document types affect their perceptions, including the enhancement of interests, the ease of information acquisition and the intention for the further use of the system. Finally, the findings are applied to develop a framework that can support for the design of multimedia learning systems.},

However, the ultimate effectiveness of an RS is dependent on factors that go beyond the quality of the algorithm. The goal of an RS is to introduce users to items that might interest them, and convince users to sample those items. What design elements of an RS enable the system to achieve this goal? To answer this question, we examined the quality of recommendations and usability of three book RS (Amazon.com, RatingZone \& Sleeper) and three movie RS (Amazon.com, MovieCritic, Reel.com). Our findings indicate that from a user's perspective, an effective recommender system inspires trust in the system; has system logic that is at least somewhat transparent; points users towards new, not-yet-experienced items; provides details about recommended items, including pictures and community ratings; and finally, provides ways to refine recommendations by including or excluding particular genres. Users expressed willingness to provide more input to the system in return for more effective recommendations.},

This paper addresses issues related to the presentation of recommendations in the movies domain. The current work reviews previous research approaches and popular recommender systems, and focuses on user persuasion and satisfaction. In our experiments, we compare different presentation methods in terms of recommendationsâ organization in a list (i.e. top N-items list and structured overview) and recommendation modality (i.e. simple text, combination of text and image, and combination of text and video). The most efï¬cient presentation methods, regarding user persuasion and satisfaction, proved to be the ââstructured overviewââ and the ââtext and videoââ interfaces, while a strong positive correlation was also found between user satisfaction and persuasion in all experimental conditions.},

For example, YouTube provides video search, related video recommendation and front page highlight. The understanding of how these features drive video views is useful for creating a strategy to drive video popularity. In this paper, we perform a measurement study on data sets crawled from YouTube and find that the related video recommendation, which recommends the videos that are related to the video a user is watching, is one of the most important view sources of videos. Despite the fact that the YouTube video search is the number one source of views in aggregation, the related video recommendation is the main source of views for the majority of the videos on YouTube. Furthermore, our results reveal that there is a strong correlation between the view count of a video and the average view count of its top referrer videos. This implies that a video has a higher chance to become popular when it is placed on the related video recommendation lists of popular videos. We also find that the click through rate from a video to its related videos is high and the position of a video in a related video list plays a critical role in the click through rate. Finally, our evaluation of the impact of the related video recommendation system on the diversity of video views indicates that the current recommendation system helps to increase the diversity of video views in aggregation.},

	abstract = {The explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender systems---a personalized information filtering technology used to identify a set of items that will be of interest to a certain user. User-based collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers, which in typical commercial applications can be several millions. To address these scalability concerns model-based recommendation techniques have been developed. These techniques analyze the user--item matrix to discover relations between the different items and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.In this article, we present one such class of model-based recommendation algorithms that first determines the similarities between the various items and then uses them to identify the set of items to be recommended. The key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items, and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item. Our experimental evaluation on eight real datasets shows that these item-based algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional user-neighborhood based recommender systems and provide recommendations with comparable or better quality.},

This article presents a novel contextual video recommendation system, called VideoReach, based on multimodal content relevance and user feedback. We consider an online video usually consists of different modalities (i.e., visual and audio track, as well as associated texts such as query, keywords, and surrounding text). Therefore, the recommended videos should be relevant to current viewing in terms of multimodal relevance. We also consider that different parts of videos are with different degrees of interest to a user, as well as different features and modalities have different contributions to the overall relevance. As a result, the recommended videos should also be relevant to current users in terms of user feedback (i.e., user click-through). We then design a unified framework for VideoReach which can seamlessly integrate both multimodal relevance and user feedback by relevance feedback and attention fusion. VideoReach represents one of the first attempts toward contextual recommendation driven by video content and user click-through, without assuming a sufficient collection of user profiles available. We conducted experiments over a large-scale real-world video data and reported the effectiveness of VideoReach.},

Despite the prominent role of the trailer within the fabric of popular media, it has rarely been discussed in terms of audience behaviour, beyond limited claims that the viewer is either misled by inaccurate advertising or has become the source of increased prosumer activity. This article therefore offers the first rigorous exploration of the disparate range of audience perspectives on, and responses to, the trailer. We show that trailer viewing can be understood as a consumption practice that is separate from (and sometimes unrelated to) feature film viewing. Analysing data collected from an online survey, we reveal that while the trailer does have informational and prefigurative value to audiences, trailer viewing is also led by criteria that include emotional attachment, cultural value and social expectation. Our analysis disputes the notion of a linear, mono-directional model of trailer-to-film viewing practices, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of the trailer audience is needed within studies of prefiguration materials and media consumption.},

	abstract = {Movie trailersâthose previews of coming attractions before the start of a feature filmâare routinely praised and reviled by moviegoers and film critics alike: âThey give away too much of the movie.â âTheyâre better than the films.â âThey only show the spectacular parts.â âThey lie.â âTheyâre the best part of going to the movies.â But whether you love them or hate them, trailers always serve their purpose of offering free samples of a film to influence moviegoing decision-making. Indeed, with their inclusion on videotapes, DVDs, and on the Internet, trailers are more widely seen and influential now than at any time in their history. Starting from the premise that movie trailers can be considered a film genre, this pioneering book explores the genreâs conventions and offers a primer for reading the rhetoric of movie trailers. Lisa Kernan identifies three principal rhetorical strategies that structure trailers: appeals to audience interest in film genres, stories, and/or stars. She also analyzes the trailers for twenty-seven popular Hollywood films from the classical, transitional, and contemporary eras, exploring what the rhetorical appeals within these trailers reveal about Hollywoodâs changing conceptions of the moviegoing audience. Kernan argues that movie trailers constitute a long-standing hybrid of advertising and cinema and, as such, are precursors to todayâs heavily commercialized cultural forms in which art and marketing become increasingly indistinguishable.},

Contextual data refers to all music-relevant information that is not included in the audio signal itself. In this article, we focus on contextual aspects of music primarily accessible through web technology. We discuss different sources of context-based data for individual music pieces and for music artists. We summarize various approaches for constructing similarity measures based on the collaborative or cultural knowledge incorporated into these data sources. In particular, we identify and review three main types of context-based similarity approaches: text-retrieval-based approaches (relying on web-texts, tags, or lyrics), co-occurrence-based approaches (relying on playlists, page counts, microblogs, or peer-to-peer-networks), and approaches based on user ratings or listening habits.

	abstract = {The rapid growth of the number of videos in YouTube provides enormous potential for users to find content of interest to them. Unfortunately, given the difficulty of searching videos, the size of the video repository also makes the discovery of new content a daunting task. In this paper, we present a novel method based upon the analysis of the entire user-video graph to provide personalized video suggestions for users. The resulting algorithm, termed Adsorption, provides a simple method to efficiently propagate preference information through a variety of graphs. We extensively test the results of the recommendations on a three month snapshot of live data from YouTube.},

	abstract = {The explosive growth in sharing and consumption of the video content on the web creates a unique opportunity for scientific advances in video retrieval, recommendation and discovery. In this paper, we focus on the task of video suggestion, commonly found in many online applications. The current state-of-the-art video suggestion techniques are based on the collaborative filtering analysis, and suggest videos that are likely to be co-viewed with the watched video. In this paper, we propose augmenting the collaborative filtering analysis with the topical representation of the video content to suggest related videos. We propose two novel methods for topical video representation. The first method uses information retrieval heuristics such as tf-idf, while the second method learns the optimal topical representations based on the implicit user feedback available in the online scenario. We conduct a large scale live experiment on YouTube traffic, and demonstrate that augmenting collaborative filtering with topical representations significantly improves the quality of the related video suggestions in a live setting, especially for categories with fresh and topically-rich video content such as news videos. In addition, we show that employing user feedback for learning the optimal topical video representations can increase the user engagement by more than 80\% over the standard information retrieval representation, when compared to the collaborative filtering baseline.},

Our method combines both behavioral and content aspects of recommendations. We first find the most related categories for the active product in the post-purchase stage. Among these related categories, products with high behavioral relevance and content relevance are recommended to the user. In addition, our algorithm considers the temporal factor, i.e., the purchase time of the active product and the recommendation time. We apply our algorithm on a random sample of the purchase data from eBay. Comparing to the baseline item-based collaborative filtering approach, our hybrid recommender system achieves significant coverage and purchase rate gain for different time windows.},

	abstract = {This article introduces the tag genome, a data structure that extends the traditional tagging model to provide enhanced forms of user interaction. Just as a biological genome encodes an organism based on a sequence of genes, the tag genome encodes an item in an information space based on its relationship to a common set of tags. We present a machine learning approach for computing the tag genome, and we evaluate several learning models on a ground truth dataset provided by users. We describe an application of the tag genome called Movie Tuner which enables users to navigate from one item to nearby items along dimensions represented by tags. We present the results of a 7-week field trial of 2,531 users of Movie Tuner and a survey evaluating usersâ subjective experience. Finally, we outline the broader space of applications of the tag genome.},

	abstract = {In this article, we take advantage of the user behavior of requesting videos from the top of the related list provided by YouTube to improve the performance of YouTube caches. We recommend that local caches reorder the related lists associated with YouTube videos, presenting the cached content above noncached content. We argue that the likelihood that viewers select content from the top of the related list is higher than selection from the bottom, and pushing contents already in the cache to the top of the related list would increase the likelihood of choosing cached content. To verify that the position on the list really is the selection criterion more dominant than the content itself, we conduct a user study with 40 YouTube-using volunteers who were presented with random related lists in their everyday YouTube use. After confirming our assumption, we analyze the benefits of our approach by an investigation that is based on two traces collected from a university campus. Our analysis shows that the proposed reordering approach for related lists would lead to a 2 to 5 times increase in cache hit rate compared to an approach without reordering the related list. This increase in hit rate would lead to reduction in server load and backend bandwidth usage, which in turn reduces the latency in streaming the video requested by the viewer and has the potential to improve the overall performance of YouTube's content distribution system. An analysis of YouTube's recommendation system reveals that related lists are created from a small pool of videos, which increases the potential for caching content from related lists and reordering based on the content in the cache.},
